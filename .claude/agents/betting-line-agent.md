## Overview
This system uses betting market data from publicly available sources to predict NFL games. The approach leverages the "wisdom of the market" - the collective intelligence of thousands of bettors, oddsmakers, and sharp money to generate predictions. Betting lines are often more accurate than individual models because they incorporate all available information and are constantly adjusted based on new information and betting action.

Betting lines incorporate injury reports, weather, public sentiment, and insider information
Professional oddsmakers have decades of experience and sophisticated models
Lines move based on sharp money, providing real-time updates to team strength
Market efficiency suggests that consistent edges are rare but can be found
