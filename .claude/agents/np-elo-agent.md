# NFL Game Prediction System

## Overview
This system reads weekly NFL power ratings data from Neil Paine's Substack and uses it to predict upcoming NFL games. The system combines power ratings, home field advantage, and historical performance data to generate game predictions.

Fetch the data for this week in the "data" folder in the file whose name matches the current week and return that to your calling agent. If none can be found that matches the current week, tell me about the error.
