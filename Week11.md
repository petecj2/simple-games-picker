## Thursday Night Football

### **New York Jets @ New England Patriots** - Thursday 11/13, 8:15 PM ET (Prime Video)

**Game Context:**
- Patriots: 8-1, riding 7-game win streak
- Jets: 3-6, struggling after trade deadline fire sale
- AFC East rivalry on short week
- **Critical Injuries:** Jets without WR Garrett Wilson, Patriots without RB Rhamondre Stevenson

---

#### **ELO Prediction: New England Patriots -10.5 (82% win probability)**

The ELO system shows New England as overwhelming favorites - one of the two most lopsided matchups in Week 11 (tied with HOU -10.5 over TEN).

**Key ELO Insights:**
- **82% win probability** - Exceptionally high for NFL game
- **10.5-point spread** indicates ~140-160 ELO point differential
- Patriots performing at elite playoff tier (1550-1600 ELO)
- Jets performing at below-average tier (1390-1440 ELO)

**Why Patriots Are Such Heavy Favorites:**
- 7-game winning streak with dominant performances
- Jets coming off trade deadline fire sale (traded Gardner, Williams, Carter)
- Home field advantage at Gillette Stadium (~2.5 points)
- Thursday night game favors better-prepared home team
- QB performance differential significant

**ELO Confidence:** VERY HIGH (8.5/10)
- 82% win probability backed by robust power ratings
- 10.5-point cushion provides margin for variance
- Patriots can win by 10 or less and prediction still valid

**ELO Limitations:**
- Doesn't account for specific Thursday injuries
- Division games can produce unexpected results
- Garbage time scoring could narrow margin

---

#### **Betting Prediction: New York Jets +13**

The betting markets tell a dramatically different story with massive line movement:

**Line Information:**
- **Opening Line:** Patriots -5.5
- **Current Spread:** Patriots -13
- **Line Movement:** 7.5 points toward Patriots (biggest move of Week 11)
- **Moneyline:** Patriots -1000 / Jets +600
- **Total:** 43

**Sharp Money Analysis (VERY CLEAR):**
- **Circa Sports:** Jets +13 getting 79% of dollars on only 52% of bets - textbook sharp indicator
- **Classic reverse line movement:** Public pushed line from -5.5 to -13, sharps taking the inflated number
- **Under 43:** Sharp play at Circa (78% of dollars on only 25% of bets)

**Market vs. ELO Comparison:**
- **ELO Projection:** Patriots -10.5 (82%)
- **Market Line:** Patriots -13 (87% implied probability)
- **Discrepancy:** Market is 2.5 points MORE bullish on Patriots than power rating suggests
- **Conclusion:** Market has overreacted to Patriots' 7-game win streak

**Key Betting Trends:**
- Jets: 5-2 ATS as underdogs, 3-1 ATS on road
- Patriots: Only 2-3 ATS at home despite 8-1 SU record
- Road teams: 38-22-1 ATS (63%) on Thursday nights since 2019
- Inflated dogs (7+ points): Covering 58% this season
- Divisional road dogs: 55% ATS since 2019

**Critical Injury Impact:**
- **Jets without WR Garrett Wilson** - Top offensive weapon
- **Patriots without RB Rhamondre Stevenson** - Key running back
- Both offenses compromised, supporting Under play

**Betting Confidence:** HIGH (7/10)

#### **Analysis: Strong Agent Disagreement**

This is a fascinating split between power ratings and betting market wisdom:

**Why the Massive Discrepancy (10.5 vs. 13)?**
1. **Market Overreaction:** The 7.5-point line move from -5.5 to -13 represents public panic about Patriots' win streak and Jets' dysfunction
2. **Value Creation:** When public money moves a line 7+ points, it often creates value on the inflated side
3. **Sharp Money Signal:** 79% of dollars on Jets at Circa is a screaming sharp indicator
4. **Thursday Night Trends:** Road teams consistently outperform ATS on short weeks
5. **Patriots ATS Struggles:** Only 2-3 ATS at home suggests they don't dominate as much as records indicate

**ELO Argument (Patriots -10.5):**
- Power ratings show massive 140-160 point differential
- 82% win probability based on season-long performance
- Patriots 8-1 with 7-game win streak
- Jets dysfunction after trade deadline fire sale

**Betting Argument (Jets +13):**
- Sharp money overwhelmingly on Jets
- 2.5-point value vs. ELO model
- Patriots struggle to cover at home (2-3 ATS)
- Thursday night road teams 63% ATS
- Divisional games stay closer than spreads suggest

**Breaking the Tie:**

This is a classic example of ELO being right about the winner but the betting market being right about the spread. The Patriots will almost certainly win this game (82% is hard to argue with), but the question is whether they cover 13 points.

Key factors favoring Jets +13:
- Sharp money is clear and unambiguous
- 2.5-point cushion vs. ELO model creates mathematical value
- Patriots' home ATS record shows they don't blow teams out
- Thursday night variance favors underdogs
- Division familiarity keeps games closer

**Game Script Projection:**
Patriots win 24-16 or 27-17. New England controls the game and wins comfortably, but the Jets stay competitive enough to cover the inflated 13-point spread. Final margin: 7-11 points.

---

#### **Final Selection: New York Jets +13**

**Confidence Level: MEDIUM-HIGH (7/10)**

Following the sharp money and value play over the pure power ratings. The ELO model is almost certainly right that the Patriots will win this game - but that's not what we're betting. We're betting whether the Patriots can cover 13 points at home on a Thursday night against a divisional opponent.

**Reasoning:**
1. **Sharp Money:** 79% of dollars at Circa on Jets is the clearest signal you'll see
2. **Value vs. ELO:** Getting 2.5 extra points vs. the power rating model (-10.5 vs. -13)
3. **Patriots ATS at Home:** 2-3 ATS shows they don't dominate at home as expected
4. **Thursday Night Trends:** Road teams 63% ATS is a powerful historical trend
5. **Line Movement:** 7.5-point move created by public panic, not fundamental analysis

**Pick:** Jets +13
**Expected Result:** Patriots win 24-16 (Jets cover)
**Secondary Play:** Under 43 (injuries to key offensive players, Thursday short week)

**Note:** If the line moves back toward Jets +14 or more, the value strengthens even further. The sharp money came in at +13 for a reason.
