# Week 1 NFL Game Predictions - ESPN Pigskin Pick'em
*Analysis Date: September 3, 2025*

## Week 1 Results and Analysis
*Final Results - September 9, 2025*

**Final Records:**
- Claude Analysis: 10-6 (62.5%)
- Pete's Picks: 12-4 (75.0%)

**Key Takeaways:**
Pete's overrides were perfect (3-0), correcting picks on Bengals > Browns, Cardinals > Saints, and Steelers > Jets. The analysis overvalued home field advantage and complex statistical models, while Pete's simpler approach of evaluating quarterback play and organizational stability proved more effective in Week 1's inherent uncertainty.

**What Worked:** Late window games went 3-1 for the analysis, suggesting methodology improves with complete information. Both approaches correctly identified several key games (9 mutual correct picks).

**Week 2 Improvements:**
- Implement Friday picking for Sunday games (Thursday games still Wednesday)
- Weight organizational stability higher in early season
- Reduce confidence in home field advantages
- Maintain comprehensive injury analysis but account for depth emergence
- Continue multi-agent approach but trust simpler evaluations more

*Note: Week 1 sample size requires caution - fundamental methodology remains sound with tactical adjustments.*
