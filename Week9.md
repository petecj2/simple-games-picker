## Thursday Night Football

**Baltimore Ravens @ Miami Dolphins** - Thursday, October 30, 8:15 PM ET

**ELO Prediction**: Baltimore Ravens -3 (60% win probability)

Neil Paine's ELO ratings establish Baltimore as a modest 3-point road favorite, translating to a 60% win probability. The ELO system views these teams as relatively evenly matched, with Baltimore holding a slight edge. For the Ravens to be road favorites, their ELO rating reflects strong overall performance metrics (point differential, strength of schedule-adjusted results) throughout the season. The 60% win probability represents moderate confidence - clear enough separation to make Baltimore the preferred pick.

**Betting Prediction**: Baltimore Ravens -7.5

The betting markets show significant sharp money backing Baltimore. The line moved from an opening of -5.5 to -7.5 despite mixed public support, indicating reverse line movement - a classic sharp money signature. Key indicators: 68% of spread bets on Baltimore with the line moving in their favor, Ravens moneyline increased from -280 to -340, and Baltimore is historically dominant at 10-2 ATS in their last 12 games against Miami. Critical factor: Lamar Jackson is fully healthy after missing three games with a hamstring injury, and the Ravens are at full strength with no injury designations. Weather conditions are ideal at Hard Rock Stadium (73-80Â°F, no rain, winds under 10 mph). Baltimore (2-5) is in must-win mode with their season on the line.

**Analysis**: Both agents agree on Baltimore, making this a consensus pick. The ELO model sees Baltimore with a 60% win probability at -3, while the betting markets have moved the line to -7.5 on sharp money. The discrepancy between the ELO spread (-3) and the betting line (-7.5) is notable - the market is showing significantly more confidence in Baltimore than the power ratings suggest. This appears to be driven by:

1. **Lamar Jackson's health**: The betting markets are heavily factoring in Jackson's return to full strength after his hamstring injury
2. **Sharp money conviction**: The 2-point reverse line movement from -5.5 to -7.5 signals professional bettors have strong conviction
3. **Historical dominance**: Baltimore's 10-2 ATS record against Miami provides additional market confidence
4. **Desperation factor**: Baltimore at 2-5 is fighting for their season while Miami at 2-6 is also struggling

Given the agreement between both agents, despite the spread discrepancy, the fundamentals all point in Baltimore's direction.

**Final Selection**: **Baltimore Ravens**

Both ELO and Betting agents select Baltimore. The consensus is clear: take the Ravens on Thursday night, though the actual spread to play (-3 for ELO value or -7.5 for market consensus) depends on your confidence level in Jackson's return and Baltimore's desperation.
