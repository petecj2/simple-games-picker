## Thursday Night Football

**Baltimore Ravens @ Miami Dolphins** - Thursday, October 30, 8:15 PM ET

**ELO Prediction**: Baltimore Ravens -3 (60% win probability)

Neil Paine's ELO ratings establish Baltimore as a modest 3-point road favorite, translating to a 60% win probability. The ELO system views these teams as relatively evenly matched, with Baltimore holding a slight edge. For the Ravens to be road favorites, their ELO rating reflects strong overall performance metrics (point differential, strength of schedule-adjusted results) throughout the season. The 60% win probability represents moderate confidence - clear enough separation to make Baltimore the preferred pick.

**Betting Prediction**: Baltimore Ravens -7.5

The betting markets show significant sharp money backing Baltimore. The line moved from an opening of -5.5 to -7.5 despite mixed public support, indicating reverse line movement - a classic sharp money signature. Key indicators: 68% of spread bets on Baltimore with the line moving in their favor, Ravens moneyline increased from -280 to -340, and Baltimore is historically dominant at 10-2 ATS in their last 12 games against Miami. Critical factor: Lamar Jackson is fully healthy after missing three games with a hamstring injury, and the Ravens are at full strength with no injury designations. Weather conditions are ideal at Hard Rock Stadium (73-80°F, no rain, winds under 10 mph). Baltimore (2-5) is in must-win mode with their season on the line.

**Analysis**: Both agents agree on Baltimore, making this a consensus pick. The ELO model sees Baltimore with a 60% win probability at -3, while the betting markets have moved the line to -7.5 on sharp money. The discrepancy between the ELO spread (-3) and the betting line (-7.5) is notable - the market is showing significantly more confidence in Baltimore than the power ratings suggest. This appears to be driven by:

1. **Lamar Jackson's health**: The betting markets are heavily factoring in Jackson's return to full strength after his hamstring injury
2. **Sharp money conviction**: The 2-point reverse line movement from -5.5 to -7.5 signals professional bettors have strong conviction
3. **Historical dominance**: Baltimore's 10-2 ATS record against Miami provides additional market confidence
4. **Desperation factor**: Baltimore at 2-5 is fighting for their season while Miami at 2-6 is also struggling

Given the agreement between both agents, despite the spread discrepancy, the fundamentals all point in Baltimore's direction.

**Final Selection**: **Baltimore Ravens**

**RESULT: Ravens 28, Dolphins 6** - Baltimore dominated as predicted, covering both the ELO spread (-3) and betting line (-7.5) easily.

## Sunday and Monday Games

### **Chicago Bears @ Cincinnati Bengals** - Sunday 1:00 PM ET
- **ELO Prediction**: CIN -0.5 (52%) - Nearly a coin-flip, slight edge to Bengals at home
- **Betting Prediction**: CHI -2.5 - Line volatile (moved -1.5 → -3 → -2.5) but settled on Bears; high total at 52.5 suggests shootout expected
- **Analysis**: **AGENT DISAGREEMENT** - This is one of the closest calls of the week. ELO sees it as essentially a toss-up with a microscopic edge to Cincinnati at home (52%). The betting market opened with Bears favored and after volatile movement settled at CHI -2.5. The 52.5 total is the second-highest of the week, indicating both offenses are expected to produce. Bears are 4-4 while Bengals are struggling despite Joe Burrow. Breaking the tie: Bears have been the more consistent team this season, and the betting market's conviction (despite volatility) suggests sharp money landed on Chicago. The high total favors the team with better recent offensive performance.
- **Final Selection**: **Chicago Bears**

### **Minnesota Vikings @ Detroit Lions** - Sunday 1:00 PM ET
- **ELO Prediction**: DET -11 (83%) - Lions heavily favored with high confidence
- **Betting Prediction**: DET -9 - Rare public/sharp alignment (89% bets, 94% money on Lions); line moved UP despite heavy public action
- **Analysis**: Complete agent agreement on Detroit. This is one of the strongest consensus picks of Week 9. When the line moves WITH overwhelming public money (Lions -8.5 to -9.5), it signals sharp money is also on that side. Vikings are dealing with ongoing offensive line issues while the Lions are one of the best teams in the NFC. Both ELO (83%) and betting market show high confidence in Detroit covering a large spread at home.
- **Final Selection**: **Detroit Lions**

### **Carolina Panthers @ Green Bay Packers** - Sunday 1:00 PM ET
- **ELO Prediction**: GB -12.5 (85%) - Packers dominant favorites with very high confidence
- **Betting Prediction**: GB -13 - Large spread holding steady with no sharp disagreement
- **Analysis**: Complete agent agreement on Green Bay. The Panthers are one of the league's worst teams while the Packers are playoff contenders. The large spread (second-biggest of the week) has remained stable, indicating market consensus. ELO gives this an 85% probability, showing strong confidence in the Packers covering at Lambeau Field.
- **Final Selection**: **Green Bay Packers**

### **Los Angeles Chargers @ Tennessee Titans** - Sunday 1:00 PM ET
- **ELO Prediction**: LAC -6 (70%) - Chargers solid favorites on the road
- **Betting Prediction**: LAC -9.5 - Strong road favorite with 86% of money on Chargers; road favorites are 28-14-1 SU this season
- **Analysis**: Complete agent agreement on the Chargers. The betting line is even more confident than ELO (LAC -9.5 vs -6), showing strong market conviction. Road favorites have been dominant in 2025 (28-14-1 SU, 24-19 ATS). The Chargers' elite defense should dominate a struggling Titans offense. Minor line movement from -10 to -9.5 suggests some sharp money on Tennessee, but not enough to change the overall picture.
- **Final Selection**: **Los Angeles Chargers**

### **Atlanta Falcons @ New England Patriots** - Sunday 1:00 PM ET
- **ELO Prediction**: NE -7.5 (75%) - Patriots strong favorites with high confidence
- **Betting Prediction**: NE -5.5 - Clear sharp action evident from early line movement (-4.5 → -6); spread bettors favoring Patriots 5:1 on tickets, 8:1 on money
- **Analysis**: Complete agent agreement on New England. The Patriots saw immediate sharp action that moved the line from -4.5 to -6 before settling at -5.5. ELO is even more bullish at -7.5 (75% confidence). The Falcons have struggled on the road while the Patriots are solid at home. Both analytics and betting market strongly favor New England.
- **Final Selection**: **New England Patriots**

### **San Francisco 49ers @ New York Giants** - Sunday 1:00 PM ET
- **ELO Prediction**: SF -3 (61%) - 49ers moderate favorites on the road
- **Betting Prediction**: SF -2.5 - Small road favorite; notable total movement from 45.5 to 48.5 (3 full points) indicates sharp over action
- **Analysis**: Complete agent agreement on San Francisco. The 49ers are the better team despite being on the road. The dramatic total movement (45.5 → 48.5) suggests sharp money expects points, possibly due to defensive injuries or favorable offensive matchups. Both agents show moderate confidence with a small spread, indicating a competitive game that the 49ers should win.
- **Final Selection**: **San Francisco 49ers**

### **Indianapolis Colts @ Pittsburgh Steelers** - Sunday 1:00 PM ET
- **ELO Prediction**: IND -4 (64%) - Colts solid favorites on the road
- **Betting Prediction**: IND -2.5 - One of the clearest sharp plays of the week; line moved from -1.5 → -2.5 → -3 on heavy sharp action
- **Analysis**: Complete agent agreement on Indianapolis. This is a consensus sharp money game. The Colts have the #1 offense in yards and points per game, and professional bettors have consistently backed them throughout the week. The line movement (IND -1.5 to -2.5 to touching -3) shows clear sharp conviction. ELO's 64% confidence aligns with the betting market's assessment that Indianapolis should win on the road.
- **Final Selection**: **Indianapolis Colts**

### **Denver Broncos @ Houston Texans** - Sunday 1:00 PM ET
- **ELO Prediction**: HOU -4.5 (65%) - Texans solid favorites at home
- **Betting Prediction**: HOU -1.5 - Significant line flip from Broncos favored to Texans favored; lowest total of week (39.5-40) suggests defensive battle
- **Analysis**: Complete agent agreement on Houston. The line flip from Denver to Houston is significant and indicates sharp money moved the market. The extremely low total (39.5-40, lowest of the week) suggests a defensive struggle. Historical data shows when the line moves 2.5+ points toward the initial underdog, that team goes 17-12 ATS (58.6%). Both ELO and betting market favor the Texans at home.
- **Final Selection**: **Houston Texans**

### **Jacksonville Jaguars @ Las Vegas Raiders** - Sunday 4:05 PM ET
- **ELO Prediction**: JAX -3 (61%) - Jaguars moderate favorites on the road
- **Betting Prediction**: LV +3 - Line dropped from JAX -3.5 to -2.5/-3; sharp money indicated on Raiders getting points
- **Analysis**: **AGENT DISAGREEMENT** - ELO gives Jacksonville a 61% chance to win on the road, while the betting market shows line movement favoring Las Vegas. The line opened at JAX -3.5 and has dropped to as low as -2.5, with the market currently split between -2.5 and -3. This movement indicates sharp money on the Raiders. Breaking the tie: When sharp money moves a line toward the underdog and the market shows disagreement (split between key numbers), it often signals value on the underdog. The Jaguars have been inconsistent this season, and getting 3 points at home with sharp backing is valuable.
- **Final Selection**: **Las Vegas Raiders**

### **New Orleans Saints @ Los Angeles Rams** - Sunday 4:05 PM ET
- **ELO Prediction**: LAR -16 (91%) - Rams overwhelming favorites with highest confidence of the week
- **Betting Prediction**: LAR -14 - Largest spread of the week; line stable at massive number shows market consensus
- **Analysis**: Complete agent agreement on the Rams. This is the biggest spread and highest confidence pick of Week 9. The Saints are struggling badly while the Rams are playoff contenders. The line has remained stable despite the massive number (-13.5 to -14.5), indicating no sharp disagreement. ELO's 91% confidence is the highest of the week. The Rams should dominate at home.
- **Final Selection**: **Los Angeles Rams**

### **Kansas City Chiefs @ Buffalo Bills** - Sunday 4:25 PM ET
- **ELO Prediction**: KC -0.5 (51%) - Essentially a coin-flip with microscopic edge to Chiefs
- **Betting Prediction**: KC -2 - Sharp money backing Mahomes; line moved from KC -1.5 to -2/-2.5; total up from 50.5 to 52.5
- **Analysis**: Complete agent agreement on Kansas City. This is the marquee matchup of Week 9 - "Patrick Mahomes vs. Josh Allen, Round 10." While ELO sees it as essentially a toss-up (51%), the betting market shows clear sharp conviction on the Chiefs. The line moved from KC -1.5 to -2/-2.5, and the total jumped from 50.5 to 52.5, both indicating sharp action. Buffalo being a home underdog is rare. The Chiefs continue to get respect from professional bettors, and Mahomes' playoff track record against Allen gives KC the edge.
- **Final Selection**: **Kansas City Chiefs**

### **Seattle Seahawks @ Washington Commanders** - Sunday 8:20 PM ET (SNF)
- **ELO Prediction**: SEA -1.5 (56%) - Seahawks slight favorites on the road
- **Betting Prediction**: SEA -2.5 - Small road favorites in primetime; Jayden Daniels returned to full practice (hamstring)
- **Analysis**: Complete agent agreement on Seattle. The Seahawks are small road favorites in Sunday Night Football. Jayden Daniels' health status has been the key storyline, with his return to full practice suggesting he'll play. However, coming off a hamstring injury against Seattle's pass rush could be challenging. The Commanders are coming off a blowout loss to Kansas City. Both agents favor the better team getting points in a primetime road spot.
- **Final Selection**: **Seattle Seahawks**

### **Arizona Cardinals @ Dallas Cowboys** - Monday 8:15 PM ET (MNF)
- **ELO Prediction**: DAL -2 (57%) - Cowboys moderate favorites at home
- **Betting Prediction**: DAL -2.5 - Highest total of the week at 53.5 suggests offensive shootout expected
- **Analysis**: Complete agent agreement on Dallas. The highest total of the week (53.5) indicates both offenses are expected to score heavily. The Cowboys are small home favorites in Monday Night Football. While the spread is small (suggesting a competitive game), both ELO (57%) and the betting market favor Dallas at home. The high total suggests defensive concerns on both sides, but the Cowboys should edge out Arizona in primetime.
- **Final Selection**: **Dallas Cowboys**
