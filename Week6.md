*Final Results - Tuesday, October 14, 2025*

**Final Records:**
- Claude Analysis: 10-5 (66.7%)
- Pete's Picks: 10-5 (66.7%)

### Key Takeaways

**What Worked:**
- **High-confidence picks delivered**: 4 of 5 games with 70%+ ELO probability went our way (DEN, IND, PIT, GB, KC)
- **Tiebreaker games were solid**: 3 of 6 tiebreaker games hit (LAC, SEA, TB) - 50% on the tough calls
- **Sharp money reads**: Following the Chargers over Dolphins (+3.5) and Seahawks over Jaguars paid off despite agent disagreements

**What Didn't Work:**
- **Tiebreaker misses hurt**: 3 tiebreaker losses (NO, BAL, WSH) - all games where sharp money or home field didn't deliver
  - **Patriots over Saints**: Went against ELO for sharp money, Patriots won 25-19
  - **Ravens over Rams**: Lamar out but backed Ravens +7.5 with sharp money, Rams dominated 17-3
  - **Commanders over Bears**: Heavy favorite lost in stunner, Bears 25-24
- **Monday Night Football disasters**: 0-2 on MNF - Falcons upset Bills 24-14, Bears upset Commanders 25-24
- **Home underdogs with sharp money**: 1-3 on this strategy (only Panthers hit)

**Biggest Upsets Against Us:**
1. **Giants 34, Eagles 17** (Thu) - We had Eagles, 79% ELO favorite - MASSIVE upset
2. **Falcons 24, Bills 14** (Mon) - We had Bills -4.5, Bills were 59% ELO favorite
3. **Bears 25, Commanders 24** (Mon) - We had Commanders -4.5, Commanders were 74% ELO favorite (2nd highest confidence!)
4. **Rams 17, Ravens 3** (Sun) - We backed Ravens +7.5 with sharp money despite Lamar being out

**Biggest Wins For Us:**
1. **Chargers 29, Dolphins 27** - Tiebreaker game, followed ELO over sharp money ✓
2. **Seahawks 20, Jaguars 12** - Tiebreaker game, followed sharp money over ELO ✓
3. **Panthers 30, Cowboys 27** - Sharp money play hit, Cowboys were 78% public bets
4. **Buccaneers 30, 49ers 19** - Tiebreaker game, followed home ELO edge ✓

### Week 7 Improvements

**Adjustments for Next Week:**
1. **Be more cautious on Monday Night Football** - Went 0-2 this week, including our 2nd-highest confidence pick (WSH 74%)
2. **Reconsider home underdogs with sharp money** - This strategy went 1-3 (only CAR hit, missed on NO, BAL)
3. **Trust high-confidence ELO picks more** - The 70%+ picks went 4-1, showing the model's strength in clear mismatches
4. **Re-evaluate backup QB situations** - Ravens without Lamar got destroyed 17-3 despite sharp money backing
5. **Don't overthink close games** - When ELO shows 55-60%, trust the favorite rather than chasing sharp money angles

**What to Continue:**
- Following ELO on high-confidence picks (70%+)
- Using tiebreakers when agents disagree (went 3-3, which is expected for close games)
- Trusting superior defenses in low-scoring games (DEN 13-11, PIT 23-9)

## Thursday Night Football Result

**New York Giants 34, Philadelphia Eagles 17** - UPSET!

The Giants pulled off a stunning upset, dominating the heavily favored Eagles 34-17. Despite losing star WR Malik Nabers to ACL injury, the Giants' defense forced 3 turnovers and held Philadelphia to just 17 points. This was one of the biggest upsets of the season, as both the ELO model (79% PHI) and betting markets (89% of money on PHI) strongly favored Philadelphia. A reminder that divisional games on short weeks can produce unexpected results.

## Individual Game Analysis

### **Philadelphia Eagles @ New York Giants** - Thursday 10/9, 8:15 PM ET (Prime Video)

**FINAL SCORE: Giants 34, Eagles 17**

- **ELO Prediction**: Philadelphia Eagles (79% win probability, -9 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: Philadelphia Eagles -7.5
- **Analysis**: A stunning upset that defied all expectations. Both agents strongly favored Philadelphia, with the ELO model giving them a 79% win probability and betting markets showing 89% of money on the Eagles. However, divisional games on short weeks proved unpredictable once again. The Giants' defense dominated, forcing 3 turnovers despite missing star WR Malik Nabers.
- **Final Selection**: Philadelphia Eagles (INCORRECT - Giants won 34-17)

---

### **Denver Broncos @ New York Jets** - Sunday 10/12, 9:30 AM ET, London (NFL Network)

- **ELO Prediction**: Denver Broncos (81% win probability, -10 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: Denver Broncos -6.5. The betting markets have pulled back from the ELO's -10 projection to -6.5, but sharp money indicators show 77% of dollars on the Jets despite 65% of tickets on Denver - a reverse line movement pattern. However, the Jets' dysfunction and London travel factors favor Denver.
- **Analysis**: Clear agent agreement. The ELO model gives Denver an overwhelming 81% win probability (highest of the week), and despite some sharp money on the Jets, the Broncos' strong defense and the Jets' offensive struggles make this a confident pick. London games can be unpredictable, but Denver is the superior team.
- **Final Selection**: Denver Broncos

---

### **Arizona Cardinals @ Indianapolis Colts** - Sunday 10/12, 1:00 PM ET (CBS)

- **ELO Prediction**: Indianapolis Colts (70% win probability, -6 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: Indianapolis Colts -7.5. Most bet game by total dollars wagered. Kyler Murray is questionable with a foot injury (DNP Wed/Thu, returned Fri). Even if Murray plays, he'll be limited. The Colts are receiving heavy public backing for good reason.
- **Analysis**: Strong agent agreement. The ELO model rates this as a 70% Colts win, and betting markets have moved the line to -7.5. Murray's injury status is concerning for Arizona. The Colts' home-field advantage and healthier roster make this a clear pick.
- **Final Selection**: Indianapolis Colts

---

### **Los Angeles Chargers @ Miami Dolphins** - Sunday 10/12, 1:00 PM ET (CBS)

- **ELO Prediction**: Los Angeles Chargers (55% win probability, -1.5 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: Miami Dolphins +3.5. Sharp money showing on Dolphins +5.5 and the Under 44.5. The betting line has moved significantly from Chargers -1.5 (ELO) to -3.5, suggesting the market respects the Chargers more than the statistical model. However, sharp bettors are taking Miami points.
- **Analysis**: **AGENT DISAGREEMENT**. ELO slightly favors Chargers (55%), but betting markets have the Chargers favored by more while sharp money is on Miami. This is a coin-flip game with marginal edges. Given the Chargers' superior defense and Miami's offensive struggles without Tua at full strength, I'll lean Chargers but with low confidence.
- **Final Selection**: Los Angeles Chargers

---

### **New England Patriots @ New Orleans Saints** - Sunday 10/12, 1:00 PM ET (FOX)

- **ELO Prediction**: New England Patriots (56% win probability, -2 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: New Orleans Saints +3.5. Sharp money showing on Saints +3.5. Most bet by total dollars (4th). The market has flipped from ELO's Patriots -2 to Saints receiving points, and sharp money is backing New Orleans. This suggests professionals see value in the home underdog.
- **Analysis**: **AGENT DISAGREEMENT**. ELO marginally favors Patriots (56%), but betting markets and sharp money favor the Saints. Both teams are struggling (Patriots 1-4, Saints 2-3), but home-field advantage and sharp money indicators tip this toward New Orleans. The Saints' dome advantage is significant.
- **Final Selection**: New Orleans Saints

---

### **Cleveland Browns @ Pittsburgh Steelers** - Sunday 10/12, 1:00 PM ET (CBS)

- **ELO Prediction**: Pittsburgh Steelers (80% win probability, -9.5 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: Pittsburgh Steelers -6.5. Sharp money on Steelers -5.5. This is the 3rd most bet game by both wagers and dollars. The Steelers are one of the "locks" of the week according to sharp bettors, backing them early in the week.
- **Analysis**: Clear agent agreement. Second-highest ELO win probability (80%), and betting markets strongly favor Pittsburgh. The Browns are dysfunctional, while the Steelers' defense is elite. This is a classic AFC North mismatch with Pittsburgh's home-field advantage.
- **Final Selection**: Pittsburgh Steelers

---

### **Dallas Cowboys @ Carolina Panthers** - Sunday 10/12, 1:00 PM ET (FOX)

- **ELO Prediction**: Carolina Panthers (52% win probability, -0.5 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: Carolina Panthers +3.5. Sharp money showing on Panthers +3.5. Betting splits show Cowboys getting 78% of bets but only 62% of money on the spread, classic sharp/public divergence. The Panthers are the sharp play as home underdogs. Chuba Hubbard day-to-day but expected to play.
- **Analysis**: Clear agent agreement. ELO has this as essentially a pick'em (52% Panthers), and sharp money is hammering Carolina getting points at home. The Cowboys are dealing with multiple key injuries (Tyler Booker, CeeDee Lamb, Miles Sanders, KaVontae Turpin all OUT). Panthers at home getting points with sharp backing.
- **Final Selection**: Carolina Panthers

---

### **Seattle Seahawks @ Jacksonville Jaguars** - Sunday 10/12, 1:00 PM ET (CBS)

- **ELO Prediction**: Jacksonville Jaguars (55% win probability, -1.5 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: Seattle Seahawks -1.5 (ML -108). Sharp money indicators on Seahawks ML. The betting market has flipped from ELO's Jaguars -1.5 to Seahawks -1.5, a 3-point swing. This suggests sharp money sees value in Seattle.
- **Analysis**: **AGENT DISAGREEMENT**. ELO marginally favors home team Jacksonville (55%), but betting markets and sharp money favor Seattle. This is another coin-flip game. Given the Seahawks' better coaching and the Jaguars' ongoing dysfunction, I'll side with Seattle and the sharp money.
- **Final Selection**: Seattle Seahawks

---

### **Los Angeles Rams @ Baltimore Ravens** - Sunday 10/12, 1:00 PM ET (FOX)

- **ELO Prediction**: Baltimore Ravens (51% win probability, PK)
- **Betting Prediction**: Baltimore Ravens +7.5. Sharp money heavily on Ravens +7.5. The line has moved dramatically - Lamar Jackson is OUT (hamstring, 2nd straight game). Without Lamar, the Rams opened as huge favorites (-7.5). However, sharp bettors are hammering the Ravens getting points at home. Public is all over the Rams in "one-way traffic."
- **Analysis**: **AGENT DISAGREEMENT - BUT CLEAR SHARP MONEY**. ELO was based on healthy Lamar (51% Ravens), but he's out. Betting markets favor Rams heavily. However, sharp money is strongly on Ravens +7.5 at home. This is a classic sharp/public divergence. Ravens defense is elite, and 7.5 points at home is a lot even with backup QB. I'll fade the public and follow sharp money.
- **Final Selection**: Baltimore Ravens

---

### **Tennessee Titans @ Las Vegas Raiders** - Sunday 10/12, 4:05 PM ET (CBS)

- **ELO Prediction**: Las Vegas Raiders (59% win probability, -2.5 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: No clear pick. Sharp money on Under 42.5. Raiders TE Brock Bowers (knee) likely out for 2nd straight game. Both teams are struggling (Raiders 2-3, Titans 1-4), and this game lacks clear sharp indicators on the side.
- **Analysis**: ELO favors Raiders (59%) but betting markets show no clear sharp money on either side - only on the Under. This is a low-confidence game between two weak teams. Following ELO's stronger signal.
- **Final Selection**: Las Vegas Raiders

---

### **Cincinnati Bengals @ Green Bay Packers** - Sunday 10/12, 4:25 PM ET (CBS)

- **ELO Prediction**: Green Bay Packers (78% win probability, -8.5 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: Green Bay Packers -14.5. The line has ballooned from ELO's -8.5 to -14.5, a massive 6-point move. This suggests significant Bengals injuries or public overreaction to the Bengals' struggles. Bengals +700 ML is 2nd most bet underdog to win. Ja'Marr Chase injury status questionable.
- **Analysis**: Clear agent agreement. ELO strongly favors Packers (78%), and while the betting line seems inflated at -14.5, both systems agree Green Bay wins. The Packers are rolling, while the Bengals can't win on the road. Even if the line is too high to bet, Green Bay wins this game.
- **Final Selection**: Green Bay Packers

---

### **San Francisco 49ers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers** - Sunday 10/12, 4:25 PM ET (FOX)

- **ELO Prediction**: Tampa Bay Buccaneers (57% win probability, -2 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: San Francisco 49ers +3.5. Sharp money split: some on Bucs -2.5 early, but also sharp money on 49ers +3. Brock Purdy remains out; Mac Jones has led 49ers to 3-0 in his absence. Chris Godwin (fibula) OUT for Bucs, week-to-week.
- **Analysis**: **AGENT DISAGREEMENT**. ELO favors Bucs (57% at home), betting markets also favor Bucs -3.5, but sharp money is split with some taking 49ers points. However, with Chris Godwin out for Tampa and the 49ers showing resilience with Mac Jones, this is closer than it appears. I'll trust the home team ELO edge and Bucs' superior record, but acknowledge this is a quality matchup.
- **Final Selection**: Tampa Bay Buccaneers

---

### **Detroit Lions @ Kansas City Chiefs** - Sunday 10/12, 8:20 PM ET, SNF (NBC)

- **ELO Prediction**: Kansas City Chiefs (55% win probability, -1.5 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: Kansas City Chiefs -2.5. Sharp money on Chiefs -1.5 and Over 51/51.5. Lions +2.5 is the most bet game by both wagers (1st) and dollars (2nd). Lions +115 ML is most bet underdog to win. Public loves the Lions, but sharp money respects the Chiefs at home on SNF.
- **Analysis**: Clear agent agreement. ELO marginally favors Chiefs (55%), betting markets have Chiefs -2.5, and sharp money is on Kansas City. Despite the Lions being the public darling, the Chiefs' home-field advantage on SNF and sharp money backing make this a Chiefs pick. Andy Reid after extra preparation time is dangerous.
- **Final Selection**: Kansas City Chiefs

---

### **Buffalo Bills @ Atlanta Falcons** - Monday 10/13, 7:15 PM ET (ESPN)

- **ELO Prediction**: Buffalo Bills (59% win probability, -2.5 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: Buffalo Bills -4.5. Sharp money on Bills -3.5/-4. Most bet game (4th) by wagers. Bills -225 ML receiving heavy action. The line has moved from ELO's -2.5 to -4.5, indicating sharp money backing the road favorite.
- **Analysis**: Clear agent agreement. ELO favors Bills (59%), and betting markets have moved the line up to -4.5 with sharp money backing Buffalo. The Bills are the superior team, and despite Atlanta's home field, Buffalo should win this game comfortably.
- **Final Selection**: Buffalo Bills

---

### **Chicago Bears @ Washington Commanders** - Monday 10/13, 8:15 PM ET (ESPN)

- **ELO Prediction**: Washington Commanders (74% win probability, -7 spread)
- **Betting Prediction**: Washington Commanders -4.5. The line has moved from ELO's -7 to -4.5, suggesting some respect for the Bears or sharp money on Chicago. However, the Commanders (3-2) at home are still clear favorites over the Bears (2-2).
- **Analysis**: Clear agent agreement. ELO strongly favors Commanders (74%), and while the betting line has softened to -4.5, Washington is still the clear favorite at home. Rookie QB Jayden Daniels has been impressive, and the Commanders' offense at home should handle the Bears.
- **Final Selection**: Washington Commanders

---

## Week 6 Summary

**Agent Agreement Analysis:**
- **Both agents agreed**: 9 games (DEN, IND, PIT, CAR, GB, KC, BUF, WSH, OAK*)
- **Agents disagreed**: 6 games (LAC, NO, SEA, BAL, SF, PHI)
  - *Note: OAK had no betting agent pick, but ELO favored Raiders

**Key Games to Watch (Tiebreakers/Disagreements in bold):**
1. **LAR @ BAL**: Ravens at home with Lamar OUT, but sharp money heavily on Baltimore +7.5
2. **SF @ TB**: Quality matchup with split sharp money and key injuries on both sides
3. **SEA @ JAX**: Coin flip game with ELO favoring Jags but sharp money on Seahawks
4. **NE @ NO**: ELO favors Patriots slightly, but sharp money and home field favor Saints
5. **LAC @ MIA**: Close game with conflicting signals between models and betting markets

**High-Confidence Picks (70%+ ELO Win Probability):**
- Denver Broncos @ Jets (81%)
- Pittsburgh Steelers vs Browns (80%)
- Green Bay Packers vs Bengals (78%)
- Washington Commanders vs Bears (74%)
- Indianapolis Colts vs Cardinals (70%)

**Upset Alert:**
After the Giants shocked the Eagles on Thursday Night Football despite being 9-point underdogs, this week reminds us that even high-confidence picks can fail. The biggest remaining upset potential may be in the Ravens-Rams game, where Baltimore is getting 7.5 points at home despite missing Lamar Jackson.

**Betting Trends:**
- Sharp money showed clear divergence from public betting in several games (Cowboys-Panthers, Rams-Ravens, Lions-Chiefs)
- Home underdogs getting sharp action: Panthers, Saints, Ravens
- London game (Broncos-Jets) has split sharp indicators despite Denver being heavily favored
