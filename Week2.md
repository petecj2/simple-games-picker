# Week 2 NFL Game Predictions - ESPN Pigskin Pick'em
*Analysis Date: September 13, 2025*

## Week 2 Results and Analysis
*Final Results - September 16, 2025*

**Final Records:**
- **Pete's Picks: 11-5 (68.8%)**
- **Claude Analysis: 9-7 (56.3%)**

**Key Takeaways:** Pete's conservative approach of picking mostly favorites significantly outperformed Claude's early-season upset strategy. The betting markets and traditional analysis proved more reliable than expected organizational factors in Week 2.

**What Worked for Pete:** 
- Conservative favorite-picking strategy (14 of 15 picks were favorites)
- Only 1 upset pick (Broncos over Colts) which lost, but overall approach was sound
- Strong performance on obvious favorites (Ravens, Lions, Bills, Cowboys)

**What Didn't Work for Claude:**
- Over-emphasis on early-season organizational factors
- Too many upset picks (5+) based on "nothing-to-lose" narratives  
- Championship pressure theory didn't materialize (49ers, Bills won easily)
- Coaching transition impact was overstated

**Week 3 Improvements:** 
- Reduce emphasis on early-season upset potential
- Weight betting market wisdom more heavily
- Use organizational factors as tie-breakers, not primary drivers
- Be more selective with upset picks (1-2 max per week)
