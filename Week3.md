## Individual Games

**Miami Dolphins @ Buffalo Bills** - Thursday Night Football (Prime Video)
- **ELO Prediction**: Buffalo Bills -12.5 (85% win probability) - Highest confidence pick of the week
- **Betting Prediction**: Bills -10.5 to -12.5 with market showing heavy confidence in Buffalo covering the large spread
- **Analysis**: Both agents strongly agree on Buffalo. The ELO model gives Bills an 85% win probability while the betting market has set the largest spread of the 2025 season. Buffalo's 2-0 start (averaging 35.5 PPG) vs Miami's 0-2 struggles, combined with Bills' 15-of-17 historical dominance and Josh Allen's 20-7 prime-time record, create perfect storm for a Bills blowout. Market efficiency suggests this large spread reflects genuine talent disparity rather than an overreaction.
- **Final Selection**: **Buffalo Bills**

*Remaining Week 3 games will be analyzed Friday afternoon following the prediction timing strategy.*
