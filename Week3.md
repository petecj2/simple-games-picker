## Week 3 Results and Analysis
*Final Results - September 23, 2025*

**Final Records:**
- **Pete's Picks: 8-8 (50.0%)**
- **Claude's Picks: 5-11 (31.25%)**

- Correctly picked IND, PHI, and KC in our disagreement games (3-0 on those)

- Traditional analysis beat contrarian approach

**What Didn't Work for Claude:**
- Too contrarian on some picks (NYG over KC, LAR over PHI, TEN over IND)
- Went 0-3 on games where we disagreed
- Sharp money indicators failed badly (HOU, LAR, LV all lost)

**Biggest Surprises:**
1. **Panthers 30, Falcons 0** - Complete shock shutout (both picked ATL)
2. **Vikings 48, Bengals 10** - Massive blowout opposite of expectations (both picked CIN)
3. **Browns 13, Packers 10** - Stunning upset of 75% ELO favorite (both picked GB)
4. **Commanders 41, Raiders 24** - Despite QB injury, WSH dominated (both picked LV)

**Week 4 Improvements:**
- Be more cautious with road favorites, especially large spreads
- Consider defensive/special teams impact more heavily
- Don't overweight injury news (Commanders won big despite backup QB)
- Respect home underdogs in divisional games

## Individual Games

**Miami Dolphins @ Buffalo Bills** - Thursday Night Football (Prime Video)
- **ELO Prediction**: Buffalo Bills -12.5 (85% win probability) - Highest confidence pick of the week
- **Betting Prediction**: Bills -10.5 to -12.5 with market showing heavy confidence in Buffalo covering the large spread
- **Analysis**: Both agents strongly agree on Buffalo. The ELO model gives Bills an 85% win probability while the betting market has set the largest spread of the 2025 season. Buffalo's 2-0 start (averaging 35.5 PPG) vs Miami's 0-2 struggles, combined with Bills' 15-of-17 historical dominance and Josh Allen's 20-7 prime-time record, create perfect storm for a Bills blowout. Market efficiency suggests this large spread reflects genuine talent disparity rather than an overreaction.
