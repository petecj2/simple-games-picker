## Individual Games

### Thursday Night Football

**Seattle Seahawks @ Arizona Cardinals** - Thursday 8:15 PM (Prime Video)
- **ELO Prediction**: Arizona -2.5 (58% win probability)
- **Betting Prediction**: Seattle -1.5 after sharp money moved line 3 points from opening ARI -1.5
- **Analysis**: Significant discrepancy between ELO model favoring Arizona and betting market backing Seattle. Sharp money created a 4-point swing from the ELO prediction. Key factors include Seattle's 7-0 recent dominance over Arizona, Cardinals' injuries to James Conner (RB, OUT) and Zay Jones (WR, OUT), and Kyler Murray's poor 1-6 ATS record against Seattle. Historical trends and injury report strongly favor Seattle despite Arizona's home field advantage. The betting market's strong movement away from Arizona suggests professionals see value in Seattle's proven success in this matchup.
- **Final Selection**: **Seattle Seahawks**

### Sunday Early Games (1:00 PM ET)

**Carolina Panthers @ New England Patriots** - Sunday 1:00 PM (CBS)
- **ELO Prediction**: New England -1 (53% win probability)
- **Betting Prediction**: Patriots -5.5 with 76% of money backing despite 57% of tickets on Panthers
- **Analysis**: Both agents agree on Patriots. Market shows significantly more confidence than ELO model with 4.5-point gap. Sharp money backing Patriots despite large spread suggests Panthers viewed as severely compromised. Patriots' home field and defensive improvements create value.
- **Final Selection**: **New England Patriots**

**Washington Commanders @ Atlanta Falcons** - Sunday 1:00 PM (FOX)
- **ELO Prediction**: Washington -1 (54% win probability)
- **Betting Prediction**: Commanders -1.5 despite Jayden Daniels injury concerns
- **Analysis**: Both agents agree on Commanders. Line moved from -3 to -1.5 due to Daniels' knee injury uncertainty. If Daniels plays, significant value on Commanders. Road favorite status suggests confidence in Washington's superiority.
- **Final Selection**: **Washington Commanders**

**Philadelphia Eagles @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers** - Sunday 1:00 PM (FOX)
- **ELO Prediction**: Philadelphia -0.5 (52% win probability)
- **Betting Prediction**: Eagles -1 after sharp money drove line down from -3

- **ELO Prediction**: Los Angeles -5 (68% win probability)
